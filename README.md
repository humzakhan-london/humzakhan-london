- **Neural Computing** - Data image processing on MNIST dataset comparing MLP vs SVM Models.
- **Visual Analytics** - Analysing UK Road Traffic Data using Python Folium and Tableau.
- **Principals of Data Science** - Assessing loan applications using credit data applying Random Forest Classifier Models.
- **Machine Learning** - Classification approach on marketing campaign on bank data comparing Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Models.
- **Big Data** - Google Cloud Compute Engines.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning** - Building models Q-Learning to find most efficient route on London Underground to target destination. Running deep learning models DQN+variations applied to Lunar Lander environment from Open AI Gym. DQN and PPO were applied to Space Invaders from rllib atari learning environment.
- **Computer Vision** - We created facial emotion detection algorithms by analysing images of a broad range of faces and classifying their emotions into seven labels. We classified the two feature descriptors (HOGS & SIFT) and two classifiers (SVM & CNN) and the results were applied to images and video.
